## Questions
1) Is it necessary that two signals are the same if their autocorrelation functions are the
same? What about auto-convolution?
2) A particular data set needs human help for classification. But the dataset is huge and
the number of people available to you for classification is limited. What ideas can you try
to make the job easier?
3) If you have a set of floating point numbers which are approximate multiples of a
single number X (say within +/- 5%), how would you go about finding the largest
possible X?

## Answers 
1) `Theory`: Autocorrelation is nothing but correlation of the same signal of itself with a delayed version.
i.e Autocorrelation of 2 functions of f(t) & f(t+1)
